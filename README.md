# Codes for single-cell transcriptomic analysis of mouse spinal motor neuron diversity 
This repository provides our main codes for the computational analysis in our single-cell transcriptomic study of mouse spinal motor neuron diversity, allowing to reproduce the figures.

**All metadata** obtained from the analyses described in the manuscript can be found in the file named `metadata_annotatedClusters&umap.zip`. 

Seurat objects for reproducible analysis are publically avaiable at [figshare](https://figshare.com/projects/scRNA-seq_data_of_mouse_motor_neuron/154430)
